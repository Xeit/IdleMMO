# Not MMO, still RPG

is a real name for this idle game that can be played in your browser [here](https://xeiciu.com/idle).

Game is created so it gives you FEELING of playing MMORPG but without hundreds of hours of free time (I wasted my mmo time to create this game).

Game was inspired by my thousands of hours wasted on playing different MMORPGs like Tibia, Runescape, WoW, FF XIV, Trove, NosTale, FLYFF (and others I forgot that I played) and (also wasted) thousands of hours of second screen idle games. \o/ Love them all.
